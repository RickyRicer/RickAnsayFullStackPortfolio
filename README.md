# Rick Ansay's Full Stack Web Portfolio

This week's assignment was a difficult one! CSS and flexbox was challenging! I hope you'll enjoy this basic portfolio site. I hope to add many newly acquired skills to this in the future! Thank you for taking the time to check it out

## Lessons Learned

This was a fun and challenging project, as CSS is totally new to me. Revisiting old HTML tags, elements, etc. is something that I haven't looked at in almost 20 years. Learning about HTML semantics, and consolidation of CSS code are the biggest takeaways I have from this.
