# Rick Ansay's Full Stack Web Portfolio

This week's assignment was a difficult one! CSS and flexbox was challenging! I hope you'll enjoy this basic portfolio site. I hope to add many newly acquired skills to this in the future! Thank you for taking the time to check it out

## Lessons Learned

This project was very difficult for me, but enjoyable once I learned what was moving where! Flexbox is as frustrating as it is rewarding. It's not much, but I'm happy with the final result.
